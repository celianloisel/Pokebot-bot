## Configuring the .env File

1. Rename `.env.exemple` to `.env`:

   ```sh
   mv .env.exemple .env

2. Open the .env file in a text editor of your choice and edit the values.

## Usage

Pokebot responds to various commands. Here are some examples:

- /card <pokemon-name>: Get information about a specific Pokémon.

- /help: Display a list of available commands.

For a complete list of commands and their descriptions, use the `!help` command in your Discord server.
